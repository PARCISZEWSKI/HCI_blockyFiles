# HCI project furhat info
## State of the estate
Currently this is the initial version of the robot prototype, currently there are two versions expressive and unexpressive. 
There isn't a major difference between them as the expressions are quite underwhelming at least in the current implementation.
## How to use
There are two files provided one for each version, I recommend running either one as the differences are barely noticable.
- Launch the web interface and launch blocky
- In the web interface open the blocky skill menu
- Load your chosen blocky file provided by this repo
- If the files for some reason aren't in an .xml format you can easily convert them by placing a .xml at the end of the name of the files.
(For some reason my system converts these files to .txt so I need to change it often)
## Interacting with the bot
- To start the bot it is required to press the green start button, it can be found in the blocky skill editor.
- After pressing start the bot will be armed
- It will be waiting for someone to approach it, to simulate this you need to go to one of the windows, spawn a user and drag him into the activation zone
- After this the bot will wait for you to say hello or another greeting.
- The conversation starts, some notable phrases you need to know for it to work is: __Ian Goodfellow__ (He is the author of the book in question) and __Deep learning__ (This is the title of the book)
- The bot only has answers prepered for positive answer so try and do affirmations such as yes and okey unless it is asking for something different from context.
- Other then this I would recommend going in blind so I can get the best feedback possible on improvements and what conflicts we can forsee.

## Other things of note
The bot doesn't have any flexibility yet in it's answers or use cases, it only works in a very specific scenario keep this in mind.
We need to change the human first interaction/start of interaction by the user speaking. It feels quite unnatural and weird.
